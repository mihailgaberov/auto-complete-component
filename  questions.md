1. What is the difference between Component and PureComponent?
   Give an example where it might break my app.

   PureComponent is a React component that is optimized for performance. It does a shallow comparison of props and
   state, and only re-renders if the props or state have changed. This is done in shouldComponentUpdate method,
   whereas the regular component doesn't implement this method by default
   and will re-render every time when its parent re-renders. PureComponent can break the app when we pass props that are not primitive
   data types. For example objects or arrays, like here:

   ```
   import React, { PureComponent } from 'react';

    class MyPureComponent extends PureComponent {
        render() {
            return <div>{this.props.data.value}</div>;
        }
    }

    export default function App() {
        const [data, setData] = React.useState({ value: 0 });

        const increment = () => {
            data.value++; // Mutating the object
            setData(data); // State reference remains the same
        };

        return (
            <div>
                <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
                <MyPureComponent data={data} />
            </div>
        );
    }
   }
   ```

   Since PureComponent uses a shallow comparison, it doesn't detect changes to the data object because its reference hasn't changed.
   As a result, the component doesn't re-render, even though data.value has been updated.

2. Context + ShouldComponentUpdate might be dangerous. Why is
   that?

   It is not a good idea to use these two together, because the Context updates don't respect the shouldComponentUpdate and will re-render all subscriberd components any time the context changes. This can potentially cause unexpected behavior. The way to go around this is to use useContext hook inside functional components and avoid using shouldComponentUpdate with context dependent components.

3. Describe 3 ways to pass information from a component to its
   PARENT.

   The most common and direct way to pass information is via callback functions. The parent pass the callback function as a prop to the child component and the child calls the callback function with the information it needs. Other methods would be by using React Context API or a 3rd party state management library (e.g. Redux, Jotai, Zustand). Both methods allows parent and child components to access shared store/state and call functions to update it. There are also some not that famouse methods for passing data from child to parent, like using refs (which is more imperative way where the child exposes methods or data to the parent through a ref) or event bubbling (standard DOM events that use the 'window' object 'dispatchEvent' method).

4. Give 2 ways to prevent components from re-rendering.

By using React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders for functional components based on props. And also by using useMemo to cache expensive calculations and useCallback to memoize functions. With useMemo we make sure the reference to our object doesn't change, i.e. we don't create a new object every time and hence the component doesn't re-render. Which useCallback we make sure the function reference remains stable, so the child component doesn't re-render unnecessarily.

And as a rule of thumb we should avoid using inline functions and objects when passing props in JSX because they are getting recreated every time the component re-renders.

useCallback example:

```
const Child = React.memo(({ onClick }) => {
  console.log('>>> render Child');
  return <button onClick={onClick}>Click Me</button>;
});

function Parent() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

  const handleClick = React.useCallback(() => {
    console.log('>>> click');
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment Count</button>
      <Child onClick={handleClick} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

useMemo example:

```
const Child = React.memo(({ data }) => {
  console.log('>>> render Child');
  return <div>{data.value}</div>;
});

function Parent() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

  const data = React.useMemo(() => ({ value: 'Hello' }), []);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment Count</button>
      <Child data={data} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

5. What is a fragment and why do we need it? Give an example where it
   might break my app.

Fragment is a special wrapper element that we can use in React JSX to group elements without adding any extra DOM nodes to the page and thus polute the DOM with redundant container elements such as

<div> or <span>. It looks like this <></> or <Fragment></Fragment>. Since React components must return a single element, using a fragment allows us to return multiple elements from a component without needing to use tags like <div> just to wrap them and satifsy this rule.

For example:
Instead of using this:

```
return (
  <div>
    <h1>My App</h1>
    <p>Some text</p>
  </div>
);
```

We can use this:

```
return (
  <>
    <h1>My App</h1>
    <p>Some text</p>
  </>
);
```

Fragments cannot have attributes such as className or id, and if we need to use such on wrapper level we need to use a tag instead or it will break our app. Also if we use loops in our render we can't go with fragments because JSX doesn't know how to resolve them. We should mentiond here that the long syntax, <Fragment></Fragment> supports key attributes. I.e. if we need to use keys we could to something like:

```return items.map(item => (
  <React.Fragment key={item}>
    <li>{item}</li>
  </React.Fragment>
));
```

And this will work in a loop.

6. Give 3 examples of the HOC pattern.
   HOC is a design pattern that allows us to reuse component logic by wrapping it in another component. It is a way to add new behavior to an existing component without modifying its code. Examples of HOC could be:
   useAuthorization, useLoading, useLogging - all of these add functionality to the existing component by wrapping it and 'attaching' the new behavior to it.

   For example we can use HOC to create a protected route that only authorized users can access we could do something like this:

   ```
   const withAuthorization = (WrappedComponent) => {
        return (props) => {
            if (!props.isAuthenticated) {
                return <div>Please log in to access this page.</div>;
            }
            return <WrappedComponent {...props} />;
        };
   };

   const Dashboard = () => <div>Welcome to the Dashboard!</div>;
   const ProtectedDashboard = withAuthorization(Dashboard);

   <ProtectedDashboard isAuthenticated={true} />;
   ```

```
