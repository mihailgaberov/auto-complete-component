1. What is the difference between Component and PureComponent?
   Give an example where it might break my app.

   PureComponent is a React component that is optimized for performance. It does a shallow comparison of props and
   state, and only re-renders if the props or state have changed. This is done in shouldComponentUpdate method,
   whereas the regular component doesn't implement this method by default
   and will re-render every time when its parent re-renders. PureComponent can break the app when we pass props that are not primitive
   data types. For example objects or arrays, like here:

   ```
   import React, { PureComponent } from 'react';

    class MyPureComponent extends PureComponent {
        render() {
            return <div>{this.props.data.value}</div>;
        }
    }

    export default function App() {
        const [data, setData] = React.useState({ value: 0 });

        const increment = () => {
            data.value++; // Mutating the object
            setData(data); // State reference remains the same
        };

        return (
            <div>
                <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
                <MyPureComponent data={data} />
            </div>
        );
    }
   }
   ```

   Since PureComponent uses a shallow comparison, it doesn't detect changes to the data object because its reference hasn't changed.
   As a result, the component doesn't re-render, even though data.value has been updated.

2. Context + ShouldComponentUpdate might be dangerous. Why is
   that?

   It is not a good idea to use these two together, because the Context updates don't respect the shouldComponentUpdate and will re-render all subscriberd components any time the context changes. This can potentially cause unexpected behavior. The way to go around this is to use useContext hook inside functional components and avoid using shouldComponentUpdate with context dependent components.

3. Describe 3 ways to pass information from a component to its
   PARENT.

   The most common and direct way to pass information is via callback functions. The parent pass the callback function as a prop to the child component and the child calls the callback function with the information it needs. Other methods would be by using React Context API or a 3rd party state management library (e.g. Redux, Jotai, Zustand). Both methods allows parent and child components to access shared store/state and call functions to update it. There are also some not that famouse methods for passing data from child to parent, like using refs (which is more imperative way where the child exposes methods or data to the parent through a ref) or event bubbling (standard DOM events that use the 'window' object 'dispatchEvent' method).

4. Give 2 ways to prevent components from re-rendering.

By using React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders for functional components based on props. And also by using useMemo to cache expensive calculations and useCallback to memoize functions. With useMemo we make sure the reference to our object doesn't change, i.e. we don't create a new object every time and hence the component doesn't re-render. Which useCallback we make sure the function reference remains stable, so the child component doesn't re-render unnecessarily.

And as a rule of thumb we should avoid using inline functions and objects when passing props in JSX because they are getting recreated every time the component re-renders.

useCallback example:

```
const Child = React.memo(({ onClick }) => {
  console.log('>>> render Child');
  return <button onClick={onClick}>Click Me</button>;
});

function Parent() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

  const handleClick = React.useCallback(() => {
    console.log('>>> click');
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment Count</button>
      <Child onClick={handleClick} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

useMemo example:

```
const Child = React.memo(({ data }) => {
  console.log('>>> render Child');
  return <div>{data.value}</div>;
});

function Parent() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

  const data = React.useMemo(() => ({ value: 'Hello' }), []);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment Count</button>
      <Child data={data} />
    </div>
  );
}
```
